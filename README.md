# Astropolis

**Astropolis** is a high-gravity, autonomous space colony concept designed for long-term human settlement in the Kuiper Belt (≈40 AU from the Sun).

The project explores how a rotating torus habitat could:
- Provide near-Earth gravity (0.8–1.2 g) using rotation (~0.67 RPM at ~2 km radius)
- Sustain a population of ~100,000–300,000 people for 80+ years with no resupply from Earth
- Close the life support loop for air, water, and food (>95% recycling)
- Protect inhabitants from cosmic radiation using massive shielding
- Generate reliable power in deep space using multi-hundred-megawatt nuclear reactors

## Key Features

### Artificial Gravity
The habitat is a giant rotating torus. By spinning, it creates centripetal acceleration that feels like gravity on the inner surface.  
Target gravity: ~1 g at the living surface, so humans can live, grow up, have children, and stay healthy long-term.

### Life Support and Ecosystem
Astropolis is designed to run almost fully closed-loop:
- ~98%+ water recovery using ISS-derived purification and vapor distillation
- Oxygen recycling using Sabatier + methane pyrolysis + bioregenerative systems
- Large-scale agriculture (hydroponics, vertical farming, aquaculture) to produce 100% of food internally

### Radiation Shielding
Because there is no Earth magnetosphere at 40 AU, the habitat is wrapped in a massive stationary shield made of water, regolith, and structural material.  
Goal: reduce radiation levels inside the colony to near Earth surface levels so that multi-generational life is biologically safe.

### Power
At 40 AU, sunlight is extremely weak (~0.05% of Earth sunlight), so Astropolis uses:
- Nuclear fission reactors (hundreds of megawatts electrical)
- Local thermal radiators for heat rejection
- Limited solar collection only as emergency backup

### Internal Zoning
The torus interior is divided into:
- Residential sectors (housing, schools, hospitals, parks)
- Agricultural sectors (farms, vertical grow towers, aquaculture)
- Industrial sectors (maintenance, materials processing, recycling systems)
- Research/education sectors (labs in both 1 g and 0 g)
- Recreation areas for mental health and social stability

The non-rotating central hub supports docking, manufacturing in microgravity, storage, and transport between 0 g and 1 g zones.

## Motivation

Astropolis asks a simple but serious question:
**Can humanity build and sustain a real city — not just a station — beyond Neptune, without constant help from Earth?**

To answer that, we focus on:
- Biology: Can people live their whole lives in artificial gravity?
- Engineering: Can we recycle everything we need (air, water, food, parts)?
- Society: Can 100,000+ people stay stable, educated, and mentally healthy while isolated for decades?

This is not just spaceship survival. This is civilization continuity.
